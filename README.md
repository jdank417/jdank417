# Hello World, I'm Jason Dank! üëã

I'm an aspiring Machine Learning Software Developer pursuing a Computer Science degree with minors in Data Science, Applied Mathematics, Business Analytics, and Computer Networking at Wentworth Institute of Technology. My passion lies in developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between complex data and actionable insights. I am currently working at Harvard University Information Technology as an Endpoint Systems Engineer

## üî≠ Featured Projects

- **[GraceryBarcodeScanner](https://github.com/jdank417/GroceryBarcodeScanner):** Developed a grocery barcode scanning web application that allows customers of my campus grocery store to more easily access price information. This is done by using an onboard Convolutional Neural network to identify the barcode in the image and Pyzbar to decode it and get the information from either the Excel or SQLite database.

- **[Remote_Monitering](https://github.com/jdank417/Remote_Monitering):** Created a solution for remotely monitoring system information using Python, Flask, and PowerShell. The application displays real-time system metrics gathered from remote machines.

- **[Deep Learning for Stock Market Predictions](https://github.com/jdank417/Deep-Learning-for-Stock-Market-Predictions):** Designed a pipeline integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict stock prices, capturing both spatial and temporal patterns in stock data.

- **[HUIT_BOT](https://github.com/jdank417/HUIT_BOT):** Developed "The Optimistic Optimizer," a chatbot utilizing Natural Language Processing to assist new hires at Harvard University Information Technology by referencing documented information from past technicians by using natural language in a conversational format rather than fishing through a knowledge base.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Java, C, C++, Powershell, Linux Bash, SQLite  
- **Machine Learning & Data Analysis:** TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
